Current item:
	Turrets shoot and monsters take damage

Previous floor above at 50% opacity

next floor below at 50% opacity

maybe separate out description from menu

Achievements:
	Shooty McShootFace : have a turret with 100+ kills
	Slaughter: Have over 1000 total kills

Maybe rather than turrets have farms ... point is to create sustainable humanity?

Library: Speeds up labs
	Can only be built adjacent to existing libraries
	Libraries are gifted randomly by "dignitaries" at milestones
	
Kitchen, and walk-in freezer.
	If freezer is adjacent to turret, enables slowing bullets

Upgrades should go back to being stored more simply in floor tiles

Maybe population should increase faster with more (either more pop or more habitats)

Background images changes as tower gets higher ... you can reach cloud level then space level where aliens are like wtfmate pew pew.

Menu always visible
Visual up arrow somewhere (next to stairs?)
Platform bigger

Blinking icon on the screen indicating current "need"
	Beds, then stairs, then monsters

Start with one turret
Visual cue for attention is required at base

Number the floors
